# AdventureWorks Business Intelligence Solution

## Project Overview

Adventure Works Cycles*, a global manufacturing company, has hired you to design and deliver an end-to-end business intelligence solution from scratch. The goal of this project is to enable the tracking of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as sales, revenue, profit, and returns. Additionally, the solution should allow for regional performance comparison, analysis of product-level trends and forecasts, and the identification of high-value customers. The only resources provided for this project are raw CSV files containing transaction, return, product, customer, and territory information.

## Project Objectives

Your primary objectives in this project are as follows:

1. **Data Integration**: Connect to and transform the raw CSV data files to create a unified dataset.

2. **Relational Data Model**: Build a robust relational data model that enables efficient data analysis and reporting.

3. **Calculated Columns and DAX Measures**: Create new calculated columns and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures to facilitate KPI tracking and advanced analytics.

4. **Interactive Reporting**: Design an interactive report using Power BI Desktop that allows users to analyze and visualize the data effectively.

## Getting Started

To start working on this project, follow these steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract the raw CSV files containing transaction, return, product, customer, and territory data.

2. **Data Transformation**: Use Power BI's data transformation capabilities to clean, reshape, and integrate the data into a single dataset.

3. **Data Modeling**: Build a relational data model that defines the relationships between tables (e.g., connecting transactions to customers and products).

4. **Calculated Columns and DAX Measures**: Create calculated columns and DAX measures to calculate KPIs such as sales, revenue, profit, and returns.

5. **Report Design**: Design an interactive report in Power BI Desktop that includes visualizations for regional performance comparison, product-level trends and forecasts, and high-value customer identification.

6. **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test the solution to ensure data accuracy and the functionality of calculated measures.

7. **Documentation**: Document the data integration, data model, and any calculations made, including a guide on how to use the report.

## Project Tools

The following tools and technologies will be essential for this project:

- **Power BI Desktop**: Used for data extraction, transformation, modeling, and report design.

## Data Sources

The project relies on the following raw data sources in CSV format:

- **Transactions**: Contains transaction data, including sales and returns.
- **Products**: Includes information about products.
- **Customers**: Contains data about customers.
- **Territories**: Provides details about regional territories.

## Project Deliverables

Upon completion, this project will deliver the following:

1. A fully functional Power BI report with interactive visualizations.
2. A documented data model that explains the relationships between tables.
3. Documentation for calculated columns and DAX measures.
4. A user guide on how to use and navigate the Power BI report.
